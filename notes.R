# current problems requiring resolution -----------------------------------
# We retained item 56 in round 3 of item removal, but its item level fit was poor
# Following round 3 of item removal, its item-level fit was acceptable
# Don't know how to interpret that

# empirical plots show some mild to significant misfit for some items
# we may want to consider evaluating a different model? maybe GPCM?

# Look at item correlations: make sure there are none that are redundant
# 
# I think only the singlets in the adjusted MODFIT file is super important - that's what I
# would interpret based on my psychopathy curve paper
